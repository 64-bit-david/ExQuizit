Immediate
Goal
  Maybe best thing to do is have two stages for quiz input
    - first will be questions about what we want the quiz to be
    - second will be actual creation of quiz
   - Work on Schema to create quiz without questions
      - need to create a button that shows/hides question inputs
      - a button to make quiz specific question - answer



Later
Quiz-creator
  - fix schema, questions should not be necessity
    -  so quiz just be answers
  Add / update schema so we can implement multiple choice quiz




What about...
  - When quiz finished, save score for user
